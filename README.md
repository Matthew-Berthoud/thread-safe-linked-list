# thread-safe-linked-list
*Thread Safe Linked List in C (CSCI 544 hw 5)*

## Part 1: thread-safe linked list with mutexes
* For testing, you can run 

```
make clean
make
./test <num_threads>
```

* Also, you can use the apis in main.c in a different way by changing the `*thread` function.
* I tried to make a random assortment of behavior possible with the way I ordered things.

## Part 2: thread-safe and LOCK/WAIT-FREE linked list
* Incomplete
* I had a number of questions that I was hoping to ask the professor that I didn't get a chance to, since he was out of town
* It will be done by end of Monday (less than 24 hours after due date)
